# Capstone - Inventory System

A basic inventory system with minimal features; I admit this is by far the messiest code I've done done this year. More about this mini system is it doesn't have delete functionality. It only have one page (index.php) that contains all the necessary basic functions to make it work. Seriously, this is the most disgusting thing I've made. I didn't originally designed the schema but I did some minor changes to make it work. * there's a lot of things that needs to be added but I didn't bother *
